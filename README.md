Project Summary: This project analyzes key factors influencing H-1B visa approvals, focusing on demographics, education, industries, and employer locations by using the data from 2021 to 2023. Younger professionals (25-34 years old) dominate approvals, with applicants from India and China making up nearly 80% of successful cases. A masterâ€™s degree significantly boosts approval chances, while the technology sector and states like California, Texas, and Washington lead in H-1B job opportunities. Gender disparities persist, with men outnumbering women in technical fields. Future steps include analyzing employer-specific data and trends in salary growth or visa denials to deepen insights into H-1B dynamics.

What I Did: In this project, I analyze H-1B visa approval trends using data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and various socio-economic indicators from state-level data. I employ Python for statistical analysis, focusing on key factors like applicant demographics (age, gender, nationality, and education), employer characteristics (industry sector, salary), and regional trends (geographic distribution of H-1B opportunities). The project reveals that younger professionals (especially those aged 25-34), highly educated individuals (particularly those with master's or doctoral degrees), and applicants from India and China dominate H-1B approvals. Additionally, the technology sector leads in demand, with companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft hiring a significant portion of H-1B workers.
The insights derived from this analysis are visualized using Tableau and Python, offering actionable recommendations for future applicants. Applicants are encouraged to target high-demand roles in industries like technology, pursue advanced degrees, and consider relocating to states with strong tech ecosystems, such as California and Texas. Additionally, the project explores salary disparities and gender imbalances across different
