# H1B-Analysis

Group Members: Wenxin Liang, Yiyou Chen, Wenlin Zhao, Jooyeon Lee, Mohammed Zaid Bin Harris

Project Summary: The project investigates the impact of U.S. hospital finances on their response to COVID-19 and the resilience of community health systems. The analysis focuses on how financial factors, such as COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) funding and other key hospital financial indicators, influenced operational outcomes like overall economic health.

What I did: In this project, I focused on data cleaning, generating a heatmap to visualize correlations, and conducting linear regression models. For data cleaning, I worked with financial and operational hospital data, converting non-numeric values and filling in missing values to ensure a consistent dataset. I also filtered hospitals to include only those with consistent data across 2020 and 2021 and categorized them based on whether they received COVID-19 PHE funding.

In the analysis phase, I generated a heatmap to visualize the correlations between key variables, such as net income, net patient revenue, and hospital operating costs. This helped highlight the relationships between hospital finances and operational metrics. Additionally, I ran a linear regression according to the heatmap to assess the impact of hospital funding and financial health on operational outcomes, providing insights into how hospital finances influenced their ability to respond to the pandemic.
